## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

First Raycasting project in Hive. Goal of the assignment is to read 2D mapfile, calculate the player's angle and render the graphic on the screen based on player's point of view.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Compilation:

```shell
git clone the repository 
```

### 2. Running the Program:
There are two versions of the program: cub3D and cub3D_bonus. cub3D_bonus adds wall collision, a minimap, ability to rotate the view by moving the mouse and opening and closing the door. With cub3D_bonus, if you use 'maps/good/bonus/doggo.cub' as argument, you can also eat chicken blocks by going through it.

To compile the mandatory, do :

```shell
make
```

To compile the bonus, do :

```shell
make
```

To run the program:
```shell
./cub3D path/to/map.cub
./cub3D_bonus path/to/map.cub
```
The program takes a map file as an argument. Maps are available in the `maps` directory. Under 'maps' directory, 'good' directory should run smoothly with program, and 'bad' should be rejected. If you would like to see the doors, you should find 'bonus'under 'good' maps directory.<br/>
For example:

- `./cub3D maps/good/lava.cub` should run.
- `./cub3D_bonus maps/good/bonus/doggo.cub` should run.
- `./cub3D_bonus maps/bad/bad.cub` should fail. (for the forbidden.cub, please do 'chmod 000 maps/bad/forbidden.cub' and run)
